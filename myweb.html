    <h2>ABOUT</h2>
    <p>MY PERSONAL STATEMENT.</p>
       <p> Albert Einstein once said and I quote, “The leader is one who, out of the clutter, brings simplicity...out of discord, harmony…and out of difficulty, opportunity”. 
 As I grew older, these words have been my motivation. It is so sad we live in a world where so many people are too scared to take the lead, this sole reason made me decide to develop myself and not live cowardly.
I developed excellent communication skills and the ability to listen actively, this enabled me to encourage collaboration among team members.
I have demonstrated strong problem-solving abilities, critical thinking skills, and decision-making capabilities. 
I am also an empathetic individual that seeks to understand the needs and concerns of my peers and also create an inclusive and supportive environment for everyone.</p>
<p>I am a full time data analyst with vast experience in web development. I have a bachelors degree in Mathematics Education, which was obtained at the university of Nigeria, Nsukka.
 Outside of the classroom, I have been actively involved in various extra-curricular and volunteer activities. I was the director of social activities in the Department’s student council for three years,
 I simultaneously served as an assistant course representative for four years and also served as the General Secretary for a religious organization in my final year.</p>
  <p>In this role, I have organized and led numerous school events, such as fundraisers, cultural celebrations, and community service projects. I have also participated in the school's debate club, honing my public speaking skills and fostering critical thinking.
Moreover, I have strong commitment to community service. I have volunteered at a local Orphanage shelter, organizing food drives, and providing support to those in need. Through this activities, I have demonstrated my passion for making a positive impact on society and my ability to work collaboratively towards shared goals.
In addition to my extracurricular and volunteer activities, I have gained valuable work experience. I have worked part-time at a local groceries store, where I developed excellent customer service skills, multitasking abilities, and organizational expertise. I have demonstrated a strong work ethic, reliability, and a willingness to go the extra mile to ensure customer satisfaction. My experience in the workforce has taught me the importance of teamwork, time management, and effective communication.
In recognition of my excellent services, I have received several awards. I have been honored with the "Best Mathematics Student of the Year" award for my outstanding academic performance, leadership qualities, and commitment to community services. I have also received recognition for public speaking skills, winning the school's debating competition. My dedication to social and environmental causes has been acknowledged through the "Service Excellence" award.
In conclusion, Alexander the great once said and I quote, “I am not afraid of an army of lions led by a sheep, I am afraid of an army of sheep led by a lion. Regardless of who we are, what we are, Together, we can achieve the impossible if we have the right LEADER.</p>
